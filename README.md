# AuthorAttrubutionML

#Attributing author of a blog using sklearn 

#data is divided into 2 sections with one having limited amount of characters and articles as features and the other utilizing all of the data inside the blog as features

#features are then further split into 3 sections:
  1. all of the words inside the dataset
  2. only the function words
  3. frequency of words inside the data set
  
 #average accuracy from using all the data inside each blog as features for all 3 of the split feature sets is 56%. However, it can be seen that only a certain blogs are getting predicted for any given test data sets. this maybe because of said blogs having the most characters hence features.
 
 #average accuracy from using limiting amount of characters and articles as features for all 3 of the split feature sets is 11%. This maybe because the features sets are not big enough to accurately predict.
